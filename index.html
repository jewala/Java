      <h3>General information</h3>
      <p id="general-information-header">In general, frogs have protruding eyes, no tail, and strong, webbed hind feet that are adapted for leaping and swimming. They also possess smooth, moist skins. Many are predominantly aquatic, but some live on land, in burrows, or in trees.</p>

      <h3>Different frog species</h3>
      <p>There are several different frogs, for instance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tree frogs</li>
        <li>Tailed frogs</li>
        <li>Clawed frogs</li>
        <li>Horned frogs</li>

<h3 id="tree-frog-header">Tree frogs</h3>
<p>
  A tree frog (or treefrog) is any species of frog that spends a major portion of its lifespan in trees, known as an arboreal state. Several lineages of frogs among the Neobatrachia suborder have given rise to treefrogs, although they are not closely related to each other. As the name implies, these frogs are typically found in trees or other high-growing vegetation. Tree frogs are usually tiny as their weight has to be carried by the branches and twigs in their habitats. While some reach 10  cm (4  in) or more, they are typically smaller and more slender than terrestrial frogs. Tree frogs typically have well-developed discs at the finger and toe tips, they rely on several attachment mechanisms that vary with circumstances, tree frogs require static and dynamic, adhesive and frictional, reversible and repeatable force generation; the fingers and toes themselves, as well as the limbs, tend to be rather small, resulting in a superior grasping ability.

<h3 id="tailed-frogs-header">Tailed frogs</h3>
<p>
  The tailed frogs are two species of frogs in the genus Ascaphus, the only taxon in the family Ascaphidae. The "tail" in the name is actually an extension of the male cloaca. The tail is one of two distinctive anatomical features adapting the species to life in fast-flowing streams. These are the only North American frog species that reproduce by internal fertilization. They are among the most primitive known families of frogs.

<h3 id="clawed-frogs-header">Clawed frogs</h3>
<p>
  The clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) is a rather inactive creature. It is incredibly hardy and can live up to 15 years. At times the ponds that Xenopus laevis is found in dry up, compelling it, in the dry season, to burrow into the mud, leaving a tunnel for air. It may lie dormant for up to a year. If the pond dries up in the rainy season, Xenopus laevis may migrate long distances to another pond, maintaining hydration by the rains. It is an adept swimmer, swimming in all directions with ease. It is barely able to hop, but it is able to crawl. It spends most of its time underwater and comes to surface to breathe.

  <h3 id="horned-frogs-header">Horned frogs</h3>
  <p>
    There are several sub-species of horned frogs - mostly, the most common species are:
    <ul>
      <li>Rough horned frog</li>
      <li>Asian horned frog</li>
      <li>South American horned frog</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4 id="rough-horned-frog-header">Rough horned frog</h4>
  <p>
    Pelobatrachus edwardinae is a species of frog in the family Megophryidae. It is commonly known as the rough horned frog, Edwardina's horned frog, and Edwardina's spadefoot toad. It is endemic to northern Borneo and known from the Sabah and Sarawak provinces of Malaysia as well as from Brunei. Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests and rivers.
  </p>
  <h4 id="asian-horned-frog-header">Asian horned frog</h4>
  <p>
    Megophrys is a genus of frogs in the family Megophryidae. They are endemic to Indonesia, where they are found on the islands of Java and Sumatra. They commonly have elongated upper "eyebrows" and are thus known as Indonesian horned toads. This group was thought to contain many more species and have a much wider distribution prior to recent taxonomic revisions
  </p>
  <h4 id="south-american-frog-header">South American frog</h4>
  <p>
    Ceratophrys is a genus of frogs in the family Ceratophryidae. They are also known as South American horned frogs as well as Pacman frogs due to their characteristic round shape and large mouth, reminiscent of the video game character Pac-Man.
